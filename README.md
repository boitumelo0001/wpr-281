In this phase, you are required to meticulously plan how you will develop the proposed 
solution. You may use various tools to aid in your planning, but certain components are 
mandatory: 
Flowchart or Pseudocode 
Develop a flowchart or pseudocode to outline the logical structure of your application. 
Topic Identification 
Class Diagram 
Identify all the relevant topics covered in the learning outcomes that you will utilize to develop 
the application. Explain why and how these concepts will be applied. If you plan to use 
concepts not covered in the learning outcomes, specify them, and provide a rationale for their 
inclusion. 
Provide a detailed class diagram for your application, illustrating all the objects you will be 
using. 
Directory Monitoring & File Management Implementation 
In this phase, you are required to implement the plan devised in Milestone 1. This involves the 
actual creation of the application as per the specified requirements. 
To summarize, for this milestone, you will need to submit the fully functional application along 
with the updated planning document (If Need be).
